# Clean Architecture

### Single Resposibility Principle

**Each module or function should have a single responsibility. This helps in creating a codebase that is easy to understand and maintain.**

TDD stands for Test-Driven Development. It is a software development methodology or approach that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. 


## Dependency Injection - DI

In Clean Architecture, dependencies are injected, which means the higher-level modules should depend on lower-level modules. This ensures that the business logic is not coupled with the infrastructure details.

## Hooks and CI
